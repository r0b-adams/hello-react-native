# lists & `<ScrollView />`

Lists can be rendered via the `map()` method just like in web React

- a `key` prop is still required

## `<ScrollView>`

[docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/scrollview)

When there is content overflow, the `<ScollView>` component is required

Many `<View>` components can be nested inside a `<ScrollView>`
