# Touchable Components Intro

`<Button>` component has utility for press events, but limited styling options

- additionally, can't attach listeners to most native components

Enter touchable components!

## `<TouchableOpacity>`

A wrapper for making views respond properly to touches.

- On press down, the opacity of the wrapped view is decreased, dimming it.

> For a more extensive and future-proof way to handle touch-based input, check out the [Pressable API](https://reactnative.dev/docs/pressable).
